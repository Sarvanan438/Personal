### **N-Layer Architecture: Notes for Interview Preparation**

The N layered architecture breaks the application into different layers
Each layer is a logical grouping of similar functionality and mostly each layer only
talks with adjacent layer i.e one above or below
Most often the layers are hierachial order of how instruction and data
flows and how each group of functionalities handle the passed data

---

#### **Definition**
- Organizes application into layers, each with distinct responsibilities.
- Common layers:
    - **Presentation Layer**: UI and user interaction logic.
    - **Business Logic Layer**: Core application rules and workflows.
    - **Data Access Layer**: Database or external data interaction.
    - **Infrastructure Layer** (Optional): Cross-cutting concerns like caching, logging.

---

#### **Responsibilities of Each Layer**
1. **Presentation Layer**:
    - Handles UI rendering and user input.
    - Patterns: MVC, MVVM.
    - Examples: React, Angular, Controller logic in backend APIs.

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
    - Encapsulates business rules and workflows.
    - Patterns: DDD, CQRS.
    - Examples: Services like `OrderService`, `AuthService`.

3. **Data Access Layer**:
    - Manages data persistence and retrieval.
    - Patterns: Repository, Active Record.
    - Examples: `UserRepository`, ORM tools (e.g., Sequelize, Mongoose).

4. **Infrastructure Layer**:
    - Cross-cutting services like caching, messaging, monitoring.
    - Examples: Redis (caching), Kafka (messaging).

---

#### **Scaling Strategies**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add instances for layers and use load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB).
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase server resources (CPU, RAM).
- **Caching**: Use Redis, Memcached for frequent data.
- **Database Optimization**: Sharding, replication for large datasets.
- **Decoupling Layers**: Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication.

---

#### **Edge Cases**
- **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid layers depending on each other indirectly.
- **Latency Bottlenecks**: Optimize inter-layer communication.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Centralize logging, error handling to avoid code duplication.

#### **Pros and Cons**
| **Pros**                                      | **Cons**                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Separation of concerns, modularity            | Complexity for simple applications.                   |
| Scalability: Independent layer scaling        | Communication overhead.                                |
| Testability and maintainability               | Performance bottlenecks if tightly coupled.           |
| Supports multiple client types                | Requires strict boundary enforcement.                 |

---

#### **Common Patterns**
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Decouples layer dependencies.
- **Factory Pattern**: Encapsulates object creation logic.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Shared resources like configurations.

---

#### **Example Scenarios**
1. **E-Commerce Application**:
    - PL: Display products, accept orders (React frontend).
    - BLL: Manage inventory, calculate discounts (OrderService).
    - DAL: Interact with database (MongoDB or SQL).
    - Infrastructure: Cache product catalog (Redis).

2. **Scaling for Millions**:
    - Use load balancers.
    - Optimize database with replication/sharding.
    - Introduce caching for frequently accessed data.

---

#### **Interview Preparation Questions**
- Design a ride-sharing platform with N-layer architecture.
- Explain how to scale an N-layer architecture for millions of users.
- Solve latency issues using caching and asynchronous communication.
